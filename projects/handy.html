<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>  <strong>What?</strong> </p>
<p>Handy is a platform for offering and hiring home repair and maintenance services based in Colombia
</p>
<p>  <strong style="margin-left:3.5rem">How?</strong> </p>
<p>It is a user driven platform where people can advertise their expertise and hire other experts. Clients search for the service they need and then pick from a list of contractors. 
</p>
<p>  <strong style="margin-left:5.5rem">Who?</strong> </p>
<p>The intended users are adults between 30 and 50 years old, who are either full time workers or caretakers and struggle to keep up with chores, as well as do maintenance tasks in their home. 
</p>
<p>  <strong style="margin-left:7.5rem">Why?</strong> </p>
<p>There is a growing market of apps that manage and facilitate freelance employment, locally, there is a lack of apps specifically designed for cleaning and maintenance services. 
</p>
</section>
<section id="research">
<h2>Research</h2>
<!--HEURISTIC-->
<section>
  <h3>Heuristic Analysis</h3>
  <p>The main local competitor for the app was selected for a heuristic analysis, with the goal of evaluating the usability 
  and user experience in order to propose relevant improvements and point out possible strengths. 
  The analysis was based on Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics, which are a set of guidelines that help identify 
  common usability problems. 
  </p>
  <div class="heuristicList">
  <div class="textImg">
  <img src="../img/search_for_services.svg" alt="magnifying glass on top od construction helmet" >
  
    <p><b>1. Searching for Services: </b>We found that the categorization of services could be overtly complex, and not very accurate to a real world interaction, confusing the user and adding unnecessary steps.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="textImg">
    <img src="../img/hiring_contractor.svg" alt="handshake" >
  
    <p><b>2. Choosing a contractor:</b> In this step  we found that it was important to earn the userâ€™s trust by giving them ample information on the available contractors in order to match the screening that would happen in a real life situation regarding experience and expertise. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="textImg">
    <img src="../img/asking_service.svg" alt="leaking pipe" >
  
    <p><b>3. Asking for a service:</b> While the form employed in the app allowed the users to closely monitor the system status
       and thus ensure all relevant information was exchanged, we found that it can come off as inrusive. It is also important 
        to give the user control about
       which information they share at what stage of the interaction. </p>
   </div>
    </div>
  <h3>Benchmark</h3>
  <p>For this analysis we selected apps with the same functionality that operate in other regions as well as one app with a similar functionality but oriented towards doctors and medical care. 
      This industry was chosen since it can face challenges regarding building trust between users and potential providers. We also went through the user reviews of these apps. 
  </p>
  <p><b>1. Interface:</b></p>
  <p>- Messaging: While all of the apps analyzed had a direct messaging feature, we found that communication was not prioritized and user often faced misunderstandings regarding the expertise
      of the contractors and the services required.</p>
  <p>- Previous hires: All of the apps incentivize the user to communicate with previously hired contractors,  
      although in some cases the information was not organized in a dedicated list that was easy to find.</p>
</p>
<p><b>2. Searching and Service Lists:</b> </p>
  <p>All of the apps struggled to keep the categories easy to use as well as flexible enough 
    for users to understand, while the search bar provided a more intuitive experience.</p>
</p>
<img src="../img/categoriesScreenshot.png" alt="list of detailed categories">


<p><b>3. Profile</b></p>
<p>- Reviews: Those apps with an overall review score out of five, as well as a comment section, provided needed information for users who might otherwise struggle to trust the contractor </p>
<p>- Pictures: There was a necessity for allowing pictures in the requests and profile, given the nature of the services provided. </p>
</section>
<!--QUESTIONNAIRE-->
<section>
  <h3>Questionnaire</h3>
  <p>A questionnaire was implemented in order to find out what prevents users from finding a contractor through an app or other online tool, 
      and how likely users are to find contractors through recommendations from friends and acquaintances.</p>
  <p><b>1. Familiarity</b></p>
  <div class="textImg">
    <img src="../img/graph83.png" alt="circle graph displaying 83%">
    <div class="text"><p> 83% of users indicated that they found the contractor via a recommendation  form someone
         or because they already knew them, thus we found most users prefer to feel close to the contractor, 
        either because they aren't a stranger, or because they are a friend.
    </p></div>
  </div>
  <p><b>2. Responsibility</b></p>
  <div class="textImg">
    <img src="../img/graph51.png" alt="circle graph displaying 51%">
    <div class="text"><p> More than 50% of users said they made recommendations in both cases (house cleaning, and maintenance), however many of them also feared being responsible if something went wrong, especially if the recommendation was given to a friend or family member.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
